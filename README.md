# Self-Hospital System Cpp
<------------------------------->
🚀 First Semester Project, Self-Hospital System in C++ 

I'm excited to share my first semester project:

 "MOON’s Hospital Information System" was developed using C++ as a console-based application.

💡 The system is designed to:

 ✅ Manage Patient Records

 ✅ Track Medical & Non-Medical Staff

 ✅ Show Doctor Availability, Timings & Room Info

 ✅ Provide Hospital Overview

 ✅ Ensure Authorized Access for Data Updates

🔒 Only authorized users can make changes, while others can view information remotely a small step toward smarter healthcare management.

🧠 Features:

Console-based User Interface

Role-Based Access (View/Edit)

Modular Menu Design

🛠️ Future Scope:

 ➡️ Add Login Authentication

 ➡️ Database Connectivity

 ➡️ Web & Mobile Versions

 ➡️ Real-Time Data Sync

📚 A proud milestone in my programming journey as a beginner learning how real-world problems can be solved with simple code.
